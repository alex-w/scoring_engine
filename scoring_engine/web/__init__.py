          produces a baffling "unexpected token <" in the console, so they get

        * A browser submitting a native ``<form method="POST">`` can only
          render HTML.  Before CSRF protection existed, a stale token on
          ``/login`` just re-rendered the sign-in form -- a scoreboard tab left

          explanation and bounce them back to the page the form lives on, which
